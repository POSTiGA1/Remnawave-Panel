## Create a user {#create-user}

Navigate to the `Users` page and click `Create user`.

<img src={require('./images/22.webp').default} width="100%" style={{borderRadius: '8px'}} alt="Create User" />

Start by choosing a username. It can be anything, but must not contain spaces.

Next, in the `Traffic & Limits` section, set the user’s data restrictions:

- `Data limit` – The traffic quota in GB.
- `Traffic reset strategy` – How often the traffic counter resets for this user.

For this example, we’ll set a **1 GB** limit with a **daily reset**.

In the `Access Settings` section, configure the subscription expiration date and assign the user to one or more Internal Squads.

Let’s set the subscription to expire in one month and assign the only available Internal Squad.  
Also, if you chose to create an External Squad, you can also assign it here.

Create the user by clicking `Create user`.

<img src={require('./images/25.webp').default} width="100%" style={{borderRadius: '8px'}} alt="User table" />

After creating the user, you’ll return to the user list.

Here, you can customize which columns are visible, toggle full-screen mode, and search users by specific fields — useful tools to help you efficiently manage an expanding user base.

### User Management Tools {#extra-settings}

If you click the pencil icon to open the `Edit user` menu, you’ll notice a new button — `More actions`.

This menu includes several useful tools beyond basic user management:

1. `Detailed Info` – Includes extra information such as VLESS UUIDs and Happ Crypto links.
2. `Show usage` – Displays detailed traffic statistics for the user.
3. `HWIDs and Devices` – Shows hardware and device info reported by client apps.
    > Note: Not all apps support this feature. If it’s empty, the user hasn’t used a compatible client.
4. `Subscription QR Code` – Generates a scannable QR code for the user’s subscription URL.
5. `Subscription links` – Displays raw subscription links like `vless://`, `ss://`, etc.
6. `Request History` – Lists all requests the user’s client apps made to fetch the subscription.

Back on the `Users` page, you’ll see a red button with a gear icon on the right — this is the **Bulk Actions** menu.

Clicking it opens a panel where you can perform actions across **all users**.

If you want to target specific users only, you have two options:

- Use the checkboxes on the left to select them manually.
- Or use the sorting/filtering tools on the right, then click `Bulk actions`.

From the Bulk Actions menu, you can:

- Activate or deactivate selected users
- Set a unified data limit and traffic reset strategy
- Extend subscription time for all selected users
- And more

### Get the Subscription URL {#get-subscription}

<img src={require('./images/26.webp').default} width="100%" style={{borderRadius: '8px'}} alt="Get subscription" />

After creating the user, you can easily get their subscription URL by clicking the **link icon** to copy it to your clipboard.

Alternatively, click the pencil icon next to it to open the `Edit user` menu, where the subscription URL is also available.

<img src={require('./images/27.webp').default} width="100%" style={{borderRadius: '8px'}} alt="User card" />

Opening this link in a browser will display the `Subscription Page`, confirming that everything is set up correctly.

<img src={require('./images/28.webp').default} width="100%" style={{borderRadius: '8px'}} alt="Subscription page" />

:::tip
You can customize the Subscription Page, as explained in one of the installation [articles](/docs/install/subscription-page/customization).

## Verifying the Setup {#remark-four}

We’ve created a user and obtained their subscription URL. Now, let’s test it by importing the subscription into a client application.

For this example, we'll use [Clash Verge Rev](https://github.com/clash-verge-rev/clash-verge-rev).

Once the subscription is imported, connect to the Node and verify that everything is working as expected.

<img src={require('./images/29.webp').default} width="100%" style={{borderRadius: '8px'}} alt="Client connection" />

As promised, you can now view updated statistics on the Panel’s Home page and within the Node’s details.

<img src={require('./images/30.webp').default} width="100%" style={{borderRadius: '8px'}} alt="Updated home stats" />

<img src={require('./images/31.webp').default} width="100%" style={{borderRadius: '8px'}} alt="Updated node stats" />
